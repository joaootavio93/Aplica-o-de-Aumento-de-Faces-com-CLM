--------------------------------------- CLM Matlab runners -----------------------------------------------------------------------------	

These are provided for recreation of some of the experiments described in the publications and to demonstrate the command line interface by calling the C++ executables from matlab. This is intended to test the Windows version of the code.

======================== Demos ==================================

run_demo_images.m - running the SimpleCLMImg landmark detection on the demo images packaged with the code
run_demo_videos.m - running the SimpleCLM landmark detection and tracking on prepackaged demo videos

feature_extraction_demo_img_seq.m - Running the FeatureExtraction project, it demonstrates how to specify parameters for extracting a number of features from a sequence of images in a folder and how to read those features into Matlab.	

feature_extraction_demo_vid.m - Running the FeatureExtraction project, it demonstrates how to specify parameters for extracting a number of features from a video and how to read those features into Matlab.	
	
The demos are configured to use CCNF patch experts trained on in-the-wild and Multi-PIE datasets, it is possible to uncomment other model file definitions in the scripts to run them instead.

======================== Experiments ============================
To run them you will need to have the appropriate datasets and to change the dataset locations.

-- head pose ---
run_clm_head_pose_tests_svr.m - runs CLM, and CLM-Z on the 3 head pose datasets (Boston University, Biwi Kinect, and ICT-3DHP you need to acquire the datasets yourself)
run_clm_head_pose_tests_clnf.m - runs CLNF on the 3 head pose datasets (Boston University, Biwi Kinect, and ICT-3DHP you need to acquire the datasets yourself)

-- landmark detection ---
"run_clm_feature_point_tests_wild.m" runs CLM and CLNF on the in the wild face datasets acquired from  http://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/resources/300-W/ 
The code uses the already defined bounding boxes of faces (these are produced using the 'ExtractBoundingBoxes.m' script on the in the wild datasets). The code relies on there being a .txt file of the same name as the image containing the bounding box. (Note that if the bounding box is not provided the code will use OpenCV Viola-Jones detector)

To run the code you will need to download the 300-W challenge datasets and run the bounding box extraction script, then replace the database_root with the dataset location.

This script also includes code to draw a graph displaying error curves of the CLNF and CLM methods trained on in the wild data.

For convenient comparisons to other state-of-art approaches it also includes results of using the following approaches on the 300-W datasets:
