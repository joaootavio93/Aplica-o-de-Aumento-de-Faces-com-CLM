# Cambridge face tracker (CLM-framework)

Framework for various Constrained Local Model based face tracking and landmark detection algorithms and their extensions/applications. Includes CLM, CLM-Z and CLNF algorithms. More details can be found in Readme.txt.

The code was written mainly by Tadas Baltrusaitis during his time at the Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge, and Institute for Creative Technologies, University of Southern California.

Special thanks goes to Louis-Philippe Morency and his MultiComp Lab at Institute for Creative Technologies for help in writing and testing the code.

The stable versions of the framework have been tagged, the latest version of Cambridge Face Tracker is is 1.2.0 and I recommend you download it.
